          EQ is Emotional Quotient or Emotional Intelligence whereas IQ is short for Intelligence Quotient.  These two are ways our brain interact with different information in all situations.

          <h2>•	Why is EQ important?</h2>
          EQ is important because Science have found that high emotional intelligence plays a huge part in driving our motivation to be better.  Our brain doesn’t stop growing and one of the reasons is that our EQ helps encourages us to learn more, practice more and therefore encourages new neurons to form in our brain to store this new information.  It is also important to help us to identify the emotions arising in us or in the different people we interact with and therefore allow us to control our expression especially during difficult scenarios.  It is the tool to allow us to empathise with others and allow us to use our IQ to provide calm, professional and effective communication skills.  The main three benefits of high EQ is stellar performance, outstanding leadership and happiness.
