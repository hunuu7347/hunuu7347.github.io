          <h2>•	What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          Emotional Intelligence is our ability to read and control our emotions and perhaps others during any situation.  That's not the only benefits that EQ has, science have found those with higher EQ are able to self-regulate and propel themselves to greater achievements. This is a reason why it is taught alot more often now.          </p>

          <h2>•	How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
          EQ is Emotional Quotient or Emotional Intelligence whereas IQ is short for Intelligence Quotient.  These two are ways our brain interact with different information in all situations.  EQ is the ability to identify, manage and express our emotions during a situation.  IQ is our capacity to learn, comprehend and apply knowledge to our daily lives as well as complex issues.         </p>
          EQ is also how we interact in a social environment.  IQ has been considered the limited standardized black and white way of defining one's intelligence.  Only recently, researchers such as Peter Salavoy, John Mayar and a few years later Dan Goleman brought up the idea of Emotional Intelligence.

          <h2>•	Why is EQ important?</h2>
          EQ is important because Science have found that high emotional intelligence plays a huge part in driving our motivation to be better.  Our brain doesn’t stop growing and one of the reasons is that our EQ helps encourages us to learn more, practice more and therefore encourages new neurons to form in our brain to store this new information.  It is also important to help us to identify the emotions arising in us or in the different people we interact with and therefore allow us to control our expression especially during difficult scenarios.  It is the tool to allow us to empathise with others and allow us to use our IQ to provide calm, professional and effective communication skills.  The main three benefits of high EQ is stellar performance, outstanding leadership and happiness.
          EQ will help one to strive and keep practice so that they are more likely to achieve higher level of performance,  it helps lift up that person leadership skills as well because it helps increase their interpersonal skills and overall lift one's happiness because it help them to be more internally more mindful of themselves.   It explains alot of difference in how one's work performance is so different in their interpersonal skills versus key performance markers.  It also pays a huge part in our information and data processing and how we outwardly portray ourselves during any situation. </p>
