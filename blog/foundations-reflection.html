      <h2>•	What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      The three things about myself is that 
      <ul>
        <li>I really did pick the right provider and the right course, because I am still really enjoying it despite them being challenging at times  </li>
      <li>I am stronger than I think.  I am learning to love myself more and more after attempting each question and pat myself when I completed it. </li>
      <li>My ego is still going strong.  I have a lot of false advertising left in me and myself. Haa </li>
      </ul> 
 
        <h2>•	What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? </h2>
        The roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning how to program as well as for a life of programming is essential as we are human beings behind the coding.  We need to keep loving ourselves and living life and doing codes that we are happy with.  It is often coding through our values that the most inspirational work is achieved. 

        <h2> •	What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h2>
        That no matter how many times you have heard it before, that it is still relevant to us today. 
    
        <h2> •	What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        That it is ok to step back and reflect, that it isn’t wasting time, especially when the deadline is so close and you really should concentrate on the due task. 
          
        <h2>•	Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
         It helps reduce burnout and in this time of self-awareness, it is important to focus on ourself as well.  It is also important to the concept  of ‘Te Whare Tapa Wha and how the Maori view our bodies as part of this great connection with the world.  It really is about helping each other to grow spiritually.
           
        <h2>•	Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </h2>
        Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. Sure it’s easy stuff to read and complete, but if I do them properly, then it is really helpful to sit back and congratulate myself for even getting to this point, and then reflecting on what works and what didn’t.  So definitely not a waste of time!
