    <h1>html-css:Inline or Inline Block</h1>

    <p>
      Inline is a great way to display information in a controlled horizontal
      way. There is no effect on the width or height as the information is
      displayed in the same line as the previous information. If you want to
      determine the weight and the height of the information but also have it
      inline, then choose the inline block.
