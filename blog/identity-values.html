    <h1>Indentity and Values</h1>
    <p>
      I identified as 40% eagle and 20% peacock, and often label by family and
      friends as blunt, stuborn and insensitive to others needs
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
      An ethical situation is lots and many, especially when I was working as an
      Optometrist. I would rather choose to recommend to a patient what their
      eye needs are, than rather sell them multiple pairs of glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.      </h2>
      My reflections on it now is the same as it was on that day, relief,
      content and at peace with myself and my morals
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
      I am a migrant from Vietnam. My parents life and their values will also
      have a mark on everything I do with my life. For example, with something
      as simple as customs around the house, I always take off my shoes upon
      entering a house or home.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
      My persistent and practical strength will always carry me through every
      hurdle I have in life. I don't often see things through rose-coloured
      glasses and knows theres a lot of work behind every success. This drives
      me to keep learning because through learning I can achieve the particular
      goal
    </p>
    <p>
      My limitations however are far and plenty. I am a perfectionist, going
      over every details over and over again. Which means when finding a
      solution, instead of sticking to the first problem, I will be easily lead
      to potential answers to other problems I may or may not have. I also get
      distracted easily so this doesn't help with my kids being distractors. I
      will need to stick to the time toggle to be able to complete the sprints
      and my learning
    </p>

      <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
      Working with others is always hard. I always feel that offering to listen
      to them first and acknowledging their concerns is always best. I am still
      applying this rule everyday to my kids. Lol.
