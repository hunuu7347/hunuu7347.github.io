    <h1>Indentity and Values</h1>
    <p>
      I identified as 40% eagle and 20% peacock, and often label by family and
      friends as blunt, stuborn and insensitive to others needs
    </p>
    <p>
      An ethical situation is lots and many, especially when I was working as an
      Optometrist. I would rather choose to recommend to a patient what their
      eye needs are, than rather sell them multiple pairs of glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      My reflections on it now is the same as it was on that day, relief,
      content and at peace with myself and my morals
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a migrant from Vietnam. My parents life and their values will also
      have a mark on everything I do with my life. For example, with something
      as simple as customs around the house, I always take off my shoes upon
      entering a house or home.
    </p>
    <p>
      My persistent and practical strength will always carry me through every
      hurdle I have in life. I don't often see things through rose-coloured
      glasses and knows theres a lot of work behind every success. This drives
      me to keep learning because through learning I can achieve the particular
      goal
    </p>
    <p>
      My limitations however are far and plenty. I am a perfectionist, going
      over every details over and over again. Which means when finding a
      solution, instead of sticking to the first problem, I will be easily lead
      to potential answers to other problems I may or may not have. I also get
      distracted easily so this doesn't help with my kids being distractors. I
      will need to stick to the time toggle to be able to complete the sprints
      and my learning
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with others is always hard. I always feel that offering to listen
      to them first and acknowledging their concerns is always best. I am still
      applying this rule everyday to my kids. Lol.
