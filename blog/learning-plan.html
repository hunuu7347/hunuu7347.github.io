      <h3>Set Rules</h2> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Practise coding everyday</li>
      <li>Smile, while I take 5 minutes break</li>
      <li>Ask Questions, never afraid to be dumb</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p> 
    <h2>30 minutes Impulses</h2>
    try to watch or do extra 30 minutes study on html or css every day; this would help with recapping the basic or learning something new.
