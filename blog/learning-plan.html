      <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

      <h3> •	What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      I would love to have a career that combines my business analyst or health skills with tech.  I feel like I would like to keep my <cough, full potential> tech 
        skills as a side hustle or hobby.  My sister has an online business that hopefully my app building skills will come in handy. 
      
      <h3>•	What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? </h3>
      I reckon my lack of confidence in my tech skills as well as time management will my biggest liability in bootcamp.  I will have to be stricter with my time and 
      depend on my family and friends more and more in bootcamp.  
      My current limitation in Bootcamp is a build up from Sprint 2, where I am a perfectionist and spread myself too much.  I have reduced my daily personal 
      ‘outside of study’ goals to try and fit in more coding.  And I know I have to trim a lot more to achieve more.  Knowing these limitations ahead of bootcamp means I have to be more vigilant from now on. 
      
      <h3>•	What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? </h3>
      Time management will be my biggest challenge.  And because of this, staying on top of the material.  Hopefully having to report to a partner while coding will mean I have to be more responsible with my time.
      
      <h3> •	What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      I would like to build on my leadership skills during this course.  I love working alongside others but obviously meeting new people in a one on one environment can be more of a challenge.  But it is a challenge I happily accept! 
      Self- awareness and learning to receive feedback is always humbling and bring me back to earth!


      <h3>•	What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? </h3>
      Support is pushing me to the right direction.  So far you all have exceed my expectation so some of the same would be great please!
      
      
      <h3>•	What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp </h3>
      Pushing myself 100% more! Because I am not meeting expectation at the moment, but the pragmatic side of me knows there is a lot more of me this time round. 
      Thus I need to ask for help sooner than think I have time to keep working on this problem. 
      <p>
      My commitment to managing the upcoming workload in Bootcamp is  updating and asking my family to help out more so I have the full 40 hours available for coding.  It also means preplanning a lot further ahead so there is no more than one non-study commitment a day.   During the weekdays, I do have to pick up my kids from school, so I will use these times as breaks from study.  I will then have to get right back to it when I get back home.  In the weekends, I will need to use this as catch-up times.
      </p>
      <p>My commitment to working productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives is to listen and respect.  It also means that I need to be truthful to them and to myself.  This will mean that I will be more responsible with my time and my work ability, seeking help in a timely manner.   
      </p>

      <h2>Foundation Learning Plan </h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          I would like to do managing roles in tech or non-direct roles in tech.  I come from a medical field so it would be awesome for me to do this amazing tech within my old optometry field. 
    </p>
    <p>        
      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
          My strengths are few and my limitations are plenty.  To sum it up, I tend to spread myself too far and wide while also being a perfectionist hence I feel I can never truly say I have finished anything in time. 
          In saying that, I am very good at managing other people's time and resources.  I can see the bigger picture (when i don't have to deal with personal matters) and get the task done with minimal effort. 
    </p>

      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          Better time management with my own personal things would be a great starter.  I would like to learn more patience so I don't look angry all the time. 
    </p>
 
    <p> 
      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
        <ul>
               <ls>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</ls>
                <ls>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</ls>
        </ul>
            I feel I have failed my commitment to this study so far.  I knew the first week will be hard for time as the preplanned family commitments and also the vast amount of new knowledge (even though we haven't barely started Javascript!).  I have schedule more time each day to commit to studying so hopefully it will be a little smoother. 
            I will need to ask questions earlier so then I can move on faster.  I currently feel I am too absorbed in one area for too long and not moving on to further knowledge. I need to learn it's not my time.   
      </p>

      <p> 
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            I need to only spend 10 minutes on learning how to self help myself and then asking questions on the #helpdesk channel.
    </p>
  </div>

        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            I would like to thank you for the patience and regular catch up from the Facilitation team.  I hope I will improve soon to show how great your effort is. 

        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
            Yes, I have 3 kids so there's pick up times, there's unpredicted tantrum times.   Thus I am learning to use as much time in between on my studying.  
            I have asked my parents and my siblings prior to committing to this course that I need everyone to look after the kids as much as possible.  They have been my rock and so I need to keep booking in their help as much as possible.

            <H3>Set Rules </H3>
        <ul> 
      <li>Practise coding everyday</li>
      <li>Smile, while I take 5 minutes break</li>
      <li>Ask Questions, never afraid to be dumb</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <h3>30 minutes Impulses</h3>
    try to watch or do extra 30 minutes study on html or css every day; this would help with recapping the basic or learning something new.
