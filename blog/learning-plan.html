    <H>Hue is this Learning Plan?</H>
    <p>
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          I would like to do managing roles in tech or non-direct roles in tech.  I come from a medical field so it would be awesome for me to do this amazing tech within my old optometry field. 
        
      <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
          My strengths are few and my limitations are plenty.  To sum it up, I tend to spread myself too far and wide while also being a perfectionist hence I feel I can never truly say I have finished anything in time. 
          In saying that, I am very good at managing other people's time and resources.  I can see the bigger picture (when i don't have to deal with personal matters) and get the task done with minimal effort. 

      <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          Better time management with my own personal things would be a great starter.  I would like to learn more patience so I don't look angry all the time. 

      <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
        <ul>
               <ls>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</ls>
                <ls>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</ls>
        </ul>
            I feel I have failed my commitment to this study so far.  I knew the first week will be hard for time as the preplanned family commitments and also the vast amount of new knowledge (even though we haven't barely started Javascript!).  I have schedule more time each day to commit to studying so hopefully it will be a little smoother. 
            I will need to ask questions earlier so then I can move on faster.  I currently feel I am too absorbed in one area for too long and not moving on to further knowledge. I need to learn it's not my time.   

        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
            I need to only spend 10 minutes on learning how to self help myself and then asking questions on the #helpdesk channel.

        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
            I would like to thank you for the patience and regular catch up from the Facilitation team.  I hope I will improve soon to show how great your effort is. 

        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
            Yes, I have 3 kids so there's pick up times, there's unpredicted tantrum times.   Thus I am learning to use as much time in between on my studying.  
            I have asked my parents and my siblings prior to committing to this course that I need everyone to look after the kids as much as possible.  They have been my rock and so I need to keep booking in their help as much as possible. 
            
            <H1>Set Rules </H1>
        <ul> 
      <li>Practise coding everyday</li>
      <li>Smile, while I take 5 minutes break</li>
      <li>Ask Questions, never afraid to be dumb</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <h2>30 minutes Impulses</h2>
    try to watch or do extra 30 minutes study on html or css every day; this would help with recapping the basic or learning something new.

  Make it practical by incorporating it in one of the webpages!
