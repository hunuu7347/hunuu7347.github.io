          <h2> Neuroplasicity-My Take</h2>
        I have been introduce to the idea of neuroplasicity a long time ago through work training as a health professional.  But with each recap on it brings new ideas and discovery on what our brain is really capable of.  
        I am always amazed and now that I have kids of my own, it is evident everyday to me what our mind can help us achieve.   
        For a long time, we were made to believe that smart kids are just born smart.   You either have the gene or not, and I guess those smart kids who didn't have smart ancestors must have mutations? 
        Now we realised those of us who aren't 'smart' are just not given the push and opportunities to excel our mind.

        Which is why it is important to treat our mind and body with love and learn to be patient with ourselves during this difficult learning period.  I am learning that my brain will pick this javascript thing up, I just need to 
        breathing and think of it differently, rather than think of it as being too diffculty and letting my emotions ran wild. 
        Because in reality, our mind can keep growing even when we are in our 90's and beyond.  I was told once about a principal of a low decile public school in the States that put more emphasis on nurturing the brain of the students
        which in turn lift the whole average scores for the schools marks on state tests.

        <p>
        A growth mindset example is when we let our action drives our ambition, action and rewarding small achievements drives our confidence in achieving bigger goals.  A fixed mindset example is when we often place black and white 
        scenarios to our choices.  For example with our health and whether we are active or not.  If we choose to have a growth mindset about our health, we would say and do small activities that increase our morale and neurons connections
        (as well as heart beat).  We also have a growth mindset about some aspect of our lives but then have a fixed mindset about other parts of us.  Learning something new means we need to be exposed to it in repetitive and useful ways to us.

        So here goes to learning Javascript in a way that it will be understanding to me!
        This neuroplasicity revision have empasis to me that I need to keep reading up and trying different ways of coding to be more confident in javascript, html and css.  
        My learning plan from now on hopefully will incorporate more of these: 
        <ul>
           <li>-reading up more methods of codes with examples of javascript.</li>
           <li>-doing my own examples as practise </li>
           <li>-utilising free coding online platform to test my codes.</li>
           <li>-definitely taking shorter breaks when frustrated and patting myself on the back more often for the bits I did correctly. </li>
           <li>-reflect on the methods I have read, codes I have done and recap on them as a quick out-loud summary may help to build more neurons connections. </li
