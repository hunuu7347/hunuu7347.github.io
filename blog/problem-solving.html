          <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
            1. were blocked on a simple problem:
            •	what was the problem?	</h2>
        The problem was when I got stuck on a JavaScript code.   I was stump because I thought I had carried out all the instruction.  And no matter what I change it to, or how many google search I have read through, the test wouldn’t pass.  And then my mind started attacking itself, blaming myself for doing this so late at night.   It just turned out to be an misspelling somewhere.  It isn’t till you resort to asking for help, then you see the wrong of your ways. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>•	what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
          I researched up the method, I read different website of search results. I tried to apply them to visual studio code.  When all this didn’t work, I then leave it all to go and have a breath.  And normally I fall asleep after this. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <h2>•	how did you feel throughout the process? </h2>
          Frustrated, self-doubting, anger, I felt lost and wonder when the answer will come.  Then come the moment when I will give in and ask for help.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>•	what did you learn? </h2>
        Surviving any problem big or small have taught me perseverance.  It has also taught me when to realise the solution is to ask for help.
        </p>

          <h2>2. elegantly solved a problem.
            •	what was the problem?        </h2>
            I don’t think I have ever solved a tech problem elegantly.   There may be other scenarios where I have solved it in a quick and ‘elegant’ way. 
            But I feel like that I could only have done that after solving previous similar problems in disastrous ways.  
          </p>
    
          <p>
            <h2>•	what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
            I feel like the best technique here is to recognise the actual problem quickly.  Because then you can move on to the next step so much quicker. 
          </p>

          <p> 
            <h2>•	how did you feel throughout the process? </h2>
            Like a pro.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h2>•	what did you learn? </h2>
          I learn that I can feel confident even in times of difficulty.
          </p>

.div "space 3"

          <p> 
            <h2>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
          <h2>•	Pseudocode </h2>
          Pseudocode will help me to understand the code aim and guidelines.  It is not meant to be the English literal algorithms but a guide to help us along the thought process of the codes.
          I am not as confident in this as I feel I don’t understand the instruction of the current problems.   
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>•	Trying something </h2>
        I am very much jump-ship when it comes to trying something new.  Sometimes blindly. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>•	Rubber ducky method </h2>
          I am still terrible at this, as talking my problems out loud and solving in front of my ‘wilson’ is still hard.  I get stump and then get frustrated because my brain doesn’t seem to pick up anything new clues, hints or solutions. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          <h2>•	Reading error messages </h2>
        No confidence in this.  I am learning the many ways undefine can be resolved.  I hope with time, I can feel more confident in this.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>•	Console.logging </h2>
          Again I have very limited confidence in this.  I understand that it is more of a tool to check the outcome of a function.  But I need to learn when to use it. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>•	Googling </h2>
          I have a lot of confidence in this, but realised there are many ways the internet can help to solve a programmer’s problems.   And googling can also bring fresh new problems which isn’t relevant to the current issue. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          <h2>•	Asking your peers for help </h2>
          I am confident in asking peers for help.  I was taught to try my damn best and therefore asking for help is a last resort.  So often I would try to find any other way and end up wasting time instead of asking for help straightaway.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>•	Asking coaches for help </h2>
          I feel now I am getting better in timing the sprint and therefore asking for help earlier.  I read through the whole sprint and allow appropriate time before I will ask the coach for help.  Thank you to John and Shrena recently for the help session as well as my peers, Gerard and Dave who responds at such crazy hours!
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>•	Improving your process with reflection </h2>
          It has been hectic lately rushing through each sprint with minimal reflection time.   I hope I will have more time to reflect on my thought process and learn from this.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2>5.	Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time? </h2>
        There isn’t a time I am not reluctant to ask for help.  It is not a matter of looking stupid in front of other students or in front the facilitators.  I find that I have to exhaust all my effort before I can say, ‘I have tried my best but now I need some help’.   I am learning to ask for help sooner than run around the problem with the same failed coding.
