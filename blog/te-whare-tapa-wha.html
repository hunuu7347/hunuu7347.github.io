      <h2>Te Whare Tapa Wha</h2>

      <img src="../Images/te-whare-tapa-wha.png" class="center" />

      Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing developed by
      Tā Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on health. The 4
      dimensions are:
      <ul>
        <li>taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</li>
        <li>taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</li>
        <li>taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</li>
        <li>taha whānau (family wellbeing)</li>
      </ul>

      This belief that Maori have in which our body and soul are connected to
      the Earth is amazing spiritual and holistic. In my culture there is alot
      of supersitions and medicine know how pass down from parents and
      grandparents to teach us younger ones about we are what we eat. And
      definitely there were a big emphasis on nurturing the land for food and
      medicine. But te whare tapa whā is so much more.

      Te whare tapa whā is how our body and spirit is made up of these walls like a house.  Each wall needs a different thing to help strengthen it. 
      please see the picture above. These are the walls: Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing),	
      Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing),	Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing),	
      Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing) and Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)
      If we do activities that specifically improve our connections with these different aspect of our lives, it will help us physically and emotionally to grow. 
      <p>
      I believe if I implement more of this doctrine into my learning and life, there will be much more
      calm, sense of wellbeing and achievement. Which is what the previous
      emotional intelligence and mindfulness approach was leading to. It is
      great that Dev Academy is implementing this as a responsibilty of all New
      Zealanders.

        I will be very proud of being a Dev Academy graduate when the times
        comes. Below is a starter of implementing more of te whare tapa wha into
        my life:
