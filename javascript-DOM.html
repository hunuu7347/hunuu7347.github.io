    <h1> Javascript-DOM</h1>
    <p>
      <h2>•	An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. </h2>
      Javascript is the interaction of the user to the Html and CSS file.   Say for instance it’s the gift and thank you note from one friend to another in acknowledgement of their social relationship.  Javascript allows the computer to create a button seeking attention and then acknowledging their attention.  It is a way for the programmer to seek a particular information from the user or just to provide pure entertainment.

      <h2>•	Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>
      The language of Javascript involves many mathematical analogues and rules but one of the important concepts of Javascript is the idea of control flow and loops.  Javascript runs each code generally from top to bottom of the page.  The control flow of usually in this way unless there are condition code or loop codes written in it as well.  Conditions are codes with statements such as ‘if’, ‘if else’ and ‘else if’.  They will run through different coding if the scenario is one way or another.  Loops are statements to allow the code to keep repeating till it meets one of the scenarios.  An example of a loop is the use of the word ‘for’ in coding.  A daily example can be our mind deciding on what to eat,  the control flow is that we often think about what we feel like eating, whether we can be bothered cooking, and what we can afford.  The loop would be we go through all of these ideas before something reasonate more with us which the amount of money is often the factor.

      <h2> •	Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
      The DOM stands for the ‘Document Object Model’.  It is like the physical skeleton map (or family tree) of the Document.  It allow us to use Javascript to identify and manipulate specific parts of the documents.  It is amazing cause you can pick up specific words in a document much like a search and find button because everything in a word document knows their seating arrangements.    An example of how we use DOM would be if we were picking up certain words using the document.querySelector to find a word or statement and then adding .innerHTML to change it another statement.

      <h2>•	Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </h2>
      Accessing data requires different method depending if its an object or an array of objects.  Accessing the elements (object) of a document, we can use the getElementById() code.  One way of getting an array of objects (technically it is a nodeList) would be the use of getElementsByClass().

      <h2>•	Explain what functions are and why they are helpful. </h2>
      Functions are like procedures, formulas that requires an input and spit out an output. They allow us to perform the interaction between a user/reader to the app or a webpage.  It allows the app to exist, function and evolve in modern day society.    Remember 25 years ago, computers and phones were much simpler and less needed.  Now they are in everyday part of our lives and everywhere on earth.
